The original mastermind game was a two player game played on a board with rows of holes in it.  For each game one player chooses a secret code which consists of four colored pegs in a certain order.  The other player then inserts a pattern of four pegs in a row as a guess at the secret code.  The first player then places up to four result pins in the small holes to the right of the other player's guess.  These pins are either white or black.  The black pins represent a correctly colored peg in the correct position, while the white pins represent a correctly colored peg that is not in the correct position.  The order of the result pins does not indicate anything.  Note that if there are two or more pegs of the same color in the secret code, and the guess contains a single peg of that color, then the result will show only one match.  (For two in the guess and three in the secret code, two will be indicated in the result, etc.)  The game is lost if the correct code is not guessed after a certain number of guesses, usually eight or ten.<p> Often in computer versions of the game, the colored pegs are represented by single digit numbers, and the result pins are represented by two numbers, indicating a correct number and position, or a correct number not in a correct position.  This version of mastermind allows you to play with either colored pegs or numbers.  In order to explain how to play the game, we will assume that the game is set up for playing with the colored pegs.  See <A HREF="../configureGame/configure.html">Game Configuration</A> for how to set up the game for playing with numbers.<p><h2>Setup and Play</h2>When you first start the Mastermind game it is in setup mode.  The game consists of the board on the left, and the control panel on the right.  You can tell the game is in setup mode because the button on the bottom of the control panel has the word "Start" on it.  While in setup mode, you need to select which colors you would like to play the game with.  This means that the secret code will be chosen from four random pegs selected from these colors only.  There may be more than one peg of a color selected.  You have to select at least 4 colors to play with.  You select which colors to play with by clicking on the color.  When a color is selected, it will have a white ring around it.  Clicking again will deselect that color.  Note that the peg at the top is just the currently selected color during game play, so don't worry about it now.  Once you have selected all the colors you want to play with, click the start button to start the game.<p>To make a guess at the secret code, click on one of the colored pegs in the control panel.  The peg at the top of the control panel will change if necessary to the same color as the peg you have selected.  Now click in one of four positions on the bottom row of the board.  Each position is indicated by a single black "hole" arranged in a row of four for each row of the board.  These rows are on the left of the board, while the result area is the smaller square section on the right end of each row.  Once you click on the position in the row, this position will be filled with a peg of your chosen color.  You can click on more than one position without going back to the control panel to select more pegs of the same color.  To select another colored peg, just click on a different colored peg (with a white ring around it) from the control panel and repeat the process.  You may change the color of a peg by clicking on top of it with a different color selected, and it doesn't matter which positions you choose to fill first.  However, once you click the last position, the guess has been finalized.The results of the guess will be indicated in the result area on the right of the row as explained above:  black pins represent a correct color in the correct position, white pins represent a correct color not in a correct position.  If you made the correct guess, you won and can start a new game if you like.  If you ran out of guesses, you lost and the correct pattern will be shown.  Note that these graphics are still being worked out so they aren't the greatest, but at least they indicate the secret code.  If you didn't win or lose, you repeat the guess process on the next row above the one you just filled in.<p>
<h2>Autopilot</h2>
The Mastermind game now has the ability to play itself.  Setup the game as normal to whatever size and type you want (don't forget to select the colors or numbers to play with), then select the Autopilot (AI) checkbox from the Game menu.  Click the start button, and the ai (artificial intelligence) will play the game.  Once it is finished you can reconfigure, or not, and click the start button again and the computer will play it again.  Deselect the Autopilot (AI) checkbox to resume normal play.
