To play with numbers, click on the Game menu in the menu bar (near the top of the window the game is in, near the left corner).  Select the radio button for Numbers.  This will open a small dialog box titled "Set Game Options."  Select the radio button for Colors to change back.<p>The Game Options dialog box allows you to change the game's configuration.  You can change the number of colors or numbers that the control panel displays for you to choose from at the beginning of a game.  You can change the number of guesses allowed before losing as well.  In a future version of the game, you may be able to alter the size  of the secret code as well, but there are some bugs with this feature, so 4 has been permanently selected for now.<p> <p></BODY></HTML>
